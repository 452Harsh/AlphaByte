 So now I am putting increment borer to test the hot wood formation in the sunroot tree. It is around 4 and half year old tree and girth is around 40 cm. And I am putting increment borer to remove the core sample to test the hot wood of the tree. So now I am putting increment borer. It is going inside and so after that we remove the core sample. So in that core sample we can test the hot wood as well as sap wood spoon. Now I applied the spoon and I am removing the core sample. So you will know what is the extent of hot wood here? Not as started, I think light smell is there. I think there is initiation of the conversion of the hot wood. So there is a colour change in the sap wood. So that is the indication of formation of hot wood in the young tree also. Ok, congratulations. It will be nice. Thank you. Thank you. Light up on the steel but it started. So how do we close it? Will there be any effect on the growth? We will put one stick, one light stick to close the hole. Within 3 months it will unite in the... All the measures of the mountain. Like why Yes, yes, you are supposed to weigh in the wood room. Now fall after this, come on to build a SG version,
